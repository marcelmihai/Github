Splunk Add-on for Bro IDS version 3.2.0
Copyright (C) 2005-2015 Splunk Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The Splunk Add-on for Bro IDS allows a Splunk software administrator to collect network flow headers from direct packet capture streams or files using the Bro IDS for parsing. You can analyze the packet capture data directly or use it as a contextual data feed to correlate with other vulnerability related data in the Splunk platform. After the Splunk platform indexes the events, you can consume the data using the prebuilt dashboard panels included with the add-on. This add-on provides the inputs and CIM-compatible knowledge to use with other Splunk apps, such as Splunk Enterprise Security and the Splunk App for PCI Compliance.
