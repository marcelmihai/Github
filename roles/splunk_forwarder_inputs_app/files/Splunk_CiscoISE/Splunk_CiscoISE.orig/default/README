Release Notes for Cisco Identity Services Engine Technology Add-on

12/31/2013


=====================
Overview
=====================

Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) produces vast amounts of machine data that can be searched, indexed, and analyzed by Splunk.  The components in this bundle are built to allow you to easily collect the data from an ISE server in addition to providing some message context.  Data is collected by Splunk via a Network Input via a traditional syslog output from the ISE server.

When using this Add-on or any UDP network input in production, there is risk for packet loss and best practices for network inputs should be considered.


=====================
Requirements and Compatibility (versions tested)
=====================

Splunk 6.0 (should work on 5.x)
Cisco ISE 1.2


=====================
Things you will need
=====================

  - IP Address of the Splunk system that will receive the data (1.1.1.2 is used in the instructions below)
  - Port that will be used on the Splunk system as a network input (514 is used the instructions below)
  - Access to the ISE Administration interface
  - Network connectivity between Splunk and ISE


=====================
Installation Instructions (Mac or Linux)
=====================

1 - Enable a Network Input on the Splunk system 
	Goto the Settings pull-down, select Data Inputs
		Select "Add New", to the right of UDP
			For UDP Port, key in 514 (this is the default syslog port and you can select any you like)
			For Set Sourcetype, select "From list"
			From the list pull-down menu, select syslog
			Click the Save button

	** To confirm functionality, port 514 should now be listening

2 - Install the Cisco ISE Technology Add-on
	Place this bundle/package in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps and unpack
	To unpack, run the following command:
	>tar zxvf ciscoIse.spl

3a - Enable ISE remote system logging to be sent to the Splunk system (From Chapter 11 of Cisco ISE User Guide, v1.2)

  ====
  Create remote logging target
  ====
  Step 1	Choose Administration > System > Logging > Remote Logging Targets.

  Step 2	Click Add.

  Step 3	Configure the following fields:

  Name:         Splunk   (Target Name - also used below in the category)
  IP Address:	1.1.1.2  (IP address of Splunk System)
  Port:		514      (Port used for Network Input)
  Target Type:	UDP (recommended, NOT the default)
  Maximum Length	8192	(Events will be broken if you use a smaller amount)

  **NOTE**  All other fields can be tuned at your discretion

  Step 4	Click Save.

  Step 5	Go to the Remote Logging Targets page and verify the creation of the new target.
  ====	

3b - Add the Remote Logging Target to the proper logging categories

  ====
  Add new target to your desired Logging Categories
  ====

  Step 1	Choose Administration > System > Logging > Logging Categories.

  Step 2	Click the radio button next to the category that you want to edit, and click Edit.

  Step 3	Add the above target (Splunk) to the following categories.  These are default log collection settings and can be tuned at your discretion:

  --Category List--
  AAA Audit 
    Failed Attemps
    Passed Authentications
  AAA Diagnostics 
  Accounting 
    RADIUS Accounting
  Administrative and Operational Audit 
  Posture and Client Provisioning Audit 
  Posture and Client Provisioning Diagnostics 
    MDM
  Profiler
  System Diagnostics
  System Statistics
  ----------------

  Step 4	Click Save.
  
  Step 5	Go to the Logging Categories page and verify the configuration changes that were made to the specific category.
  ==== 

4 - Confirm that you have successfully installed the Add-on

	To confirm that events are showing up correctly,run a search for "sourcetype=Cisco:ISE:Syslog", over a timerange that is over the last 15 minutes.  If you receive recent events that are identified as being from your ISE server, then you have successfully configured the add-on.

=================
Troubleshooting tips
=================

1 - Confirm that the ISE server is sending data to Splunk by searching for "sourcetype=syslog" and confirming they are from the IP address of the ISE server.

2 - Check or trigger events to be sent to Splunk - you won't see any data unless the ISE server is active.

3 - Confirm that Splunk is enabled to receive data - run "netstat -an" and confirm the port is listening

I'm a Splunk Expert...
=================

Here is what the package does as an add-on:

** Automatic sourcetyping for syslog events that come from Cisco ISE devices (via UDP input).  All events are classified as Cisco:ISE:Syslog.

** Message code lookup to translate codes to descriptions and classifications (fields used:  MESSAGE_CODE, MESSAGE_TEXT, MESSAGE_CLASS)

** Important key value pairs are automatically picked (No extractions required)

** Includes instructions on how to turn on events from Cisco ISE

** Does NOT include any inputs.conf (you already have this enabled or know how to)
