Palo Alto Networks Add-on for Splunk version 3.6.1

Copyright (C) 2009-2015 Splunk Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 
The Splunk Add-on for Palo Alto Networks allows a SplunkÂ® Enterprise administrator to collect data from Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall devices and Advanced Endpoint Protection. The add-on collects traffic, threat, system, configuration, and endpoint logs from Palo Alto Networks physical or virtual firewall devices over syslog. After Splunk Enterprise indexes the events, you can consume the data using the pre-built dashboard panels included with the add-on. This add-on provides the inputs and CIM-compatible knowledge to use with other Splunk Enterprise apps, such as the Splunk App for Enterprise Security and the Splunk App for PCI Compliance.
