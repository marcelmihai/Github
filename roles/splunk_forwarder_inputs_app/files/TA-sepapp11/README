Using this Technology Add-on:
----------------------------------------
	Configuration: Manual
	Ports for automatic configuration: None
	Scripted input setup: Not applicable
	
	This Technology Add-on can import data directly by monitoring files on the SEP manager. To monitor the files
    directly you'll need to set the log file location in the inputs.conf file and enable the associated file inputs. To do so:

	1. Copy the following file:
    
            $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-sep/default/inputs.conf.local
        
        To the following location:
    
            $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-sep/local/inputs.conf
        
	2.  The default path in inputs.conf assumes that the SEP Manager is installed in the following directory:
    
            C:\Program Files\Symantec\Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager
    
    	Edit this path to the actual location of the SEP Manager if necessary.
