# Splunk-Configs
This repo contains all the Splunk infrastructure related configs organized in directories.  Due to limitations in the way git allows deploy-keys to be used only for individual repos, we can create a single repo with multiple subdirectories which represent different components.  For example;
* Components
  * serverclass.conf
  * master-apps
  * shcluster
  * deployment-apps
  * buckets.d
  * ETC
